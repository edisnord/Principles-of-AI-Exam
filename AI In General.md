### What did John McCarthy NOT do?

Incredibly useless question. I'll write what he did do instead.
1. Coined the term AI
2. Invented LISP
3. Invented garbage collection
4. Created the first time-sharing systems, which later became servers
5. Added recursion and conditional expressions to ALGOL 60
6. IDEs
7. Lexical closures
8. First-class functions

### Which of these statements is true about the Turing Test and the Chinese Room argument

I'm just going to write info about them

#### The Turing test 
It's a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human through conversation.
#### The chinese room argument 
Is's an argument against the Strong AI hypothesis (Defined as "The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds") presented by John Searle. The argument is based around a thought experiment called the "Chinese Room". 

Searle's thought experiment begins with this hypothetical premise: suppose that artificial intelligence research has succeeded in constructing a computer that behaves as if it understands Chinese. It takes Chinese characters as input and, by following the instructions of a computer program, produces other Chinese characters, which it presents as output. Suppose, says Searle, that this computer performs its task so convincingly that it comfortably passes the Turing test: it convinces a human Chinese speaker that the program is itself a live Chinese speaker. To all of the questions that the person asks, it makes appropriate responses, such that any Chinese speaker would be convinced that they are talking to another Chinese-speaking human being.

The question Searle wants to answer is this: does the machine literally "understand" Chinese? Or is it merely simulating the ability to understand Chinese? Searle calls the first position "strong AI" and the latter "weak AI".

Searle then supposes that he is in a closed room and has a book with an English version of the computer program, along with sufficient papers, pencils, erasers, and filing cabinets. Searle could receive Chinese characters through a slot in the door, process them according to the program's instructions, and produce Chinese characters as output, without understanding any of the content of the Chinese writing. If the computer had passed the Turing test this way, it follows, says Searle, that he would do so as well, simply by running the program manually.

Searle asserts that there is no essential difference between the roles of the computer and himself in the experiment. Each simply follows a program, step-by-step, producing behavior that is then interpreted by the user as demonstrating intelligent conversation. However, Searle himself would not be able to understand the conversation. ("I don't speak a word of Chinese", he points out.) Therefore, he argues, it follows that the computer would not be able to understand the conversation either.

Searle argues that, without "understanding" (or "intentionality"), we cannot describe what the machine is doing as "thinking" and, since it does not think, it does not have a "mind" in anything like the normal sense of the word. Therefore, he concludes that the "strong AI" hypothesis is false. In this room an english speaker 

### Which of these tasks was NOT solved much better by Deep Learning than previous algorithms?

Deep learning greatly improved computer vision, text-to-speech and text generation

### What is NOT crucial for deep learning algorithms

Data and computational power is crutial

### Finish the sentence: Nobody supposes that the computational model of rainstorms in London

... will leave everyone wet

### Which theory says that our minds are in fact computer programs?

Computationalism

### Who was NOT present at the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence?

People who were there:
- John McCarthy
- Ray Solomonoff
- Marvin Minsky
- Claude Shannon
- John Nash
- W.S. Culloch
- Arthur Samuel
- Nat Rochester
- David Sayre
- Herbert Simon

### What was the name of the world’s first chatterbot?

ELIZA

### What was NOT one of the problems with AI identified in the Lighthill report?

Lighthill report problems:
- Not enough computational power
- Common sense knowledge and reasoning was very hard, the knowledge acquisition bottleneck
- Moravec's paradox

### What is Moravec’s paradox?

It is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult-level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one year-old when it comes to perception and mobility

### Who was not awarded the Turing prize despite being a significant contributor to deep learning?

Jürgen Schmidhuber
